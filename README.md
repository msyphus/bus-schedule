# Basic Bus Scheduler

# Demo

This app can be accessed [here.](https://msyphus.github.io/bus-schedule/) 

# General

A mockup of an app that could be used for a bus company to display route information.  Enter the bus route name, destination, first bus time, and frequency into the form and results will be stored in an external database.  Time of the next arrival and minutes left from the current time are calculated.  Data from the database is displayed in the table.

The table displays time in a 24-hour format.  It is not required, however, to use a 24-hour format in the form.
